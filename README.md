This website is built with Bootstrap and Sass. It uses Font Awesome for icons.

In order to customize this website, you need to install Node.js. Then, clone this repository and run:

npm install
This will install Bootstrap, Sass and Font Awesome. To build your CSS files from Sass, run:

npm run sass:build
To watch your Sass files for changes, run:

npm run sass:watch
You can add Bootstrap variables to the bootstrap.scss file. You can look at the file node_modules/bootstrap/dist/scss/_variables.scss for a list of all the variables. Do NOT edit the variables.scss file directly, as it will be overwritten when you update Bootstrap.

To add your own custom styles, use the styles.scss file.
